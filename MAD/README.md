- Incase of error while running, look at `~/.cache/Google/AndroidStudio2023.1/log/idea.log for error stack`
- When encountered `The emulator process for AVD _ has terminated.` error, follow either of below solution:
    - Free up disk space to accomodate the emulator device
    - Install minimum emulator with smaller resolution and older OS like "Small Phone API 28"(which needs aroud 3-4 gb of free space)
